# Fraud-Transaction-Detection
Implementation of a predictive model for predicting fraud transactions.

Purpose of this project is to build a predictive model to identify or predict the abnormal or fraud transactions to avoid future financial loss as well as to improve the financial security for the customers. 
Implemented a classification model(more than 90% accuracy) to predict fraud transactions based on customersâ€™ transaction history, purchase patterns. 
Model is trained on PCA features as data is confidential and is implemented with LDA, XGBoost, SVM, LR, Random Forests and KNN machine learning algorithms.
And the models are evaluated with F1-Score and Accuracy and comapred the results of all models to get the best model.

This project explains step by step procedure to implement a predictive model to predect fraud transactions.
